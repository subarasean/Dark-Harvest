# Dark-Harvest
Dark Harvest is a first-person horror survival game where the narrative and gameplay adapt to player behavior. Built in Unity, the game uses machine learning and AI pathfinding (A* algorithm) to deliver a personalized and reactive horror experience.

Unfortunately, due to some asset files being large I cannot upload the game here. Here is the gdrive link along with ingame screenshots for those curious: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X2quh-XxHiai-0c9xJLTGT6Pdy_3VaJx?usp=sharing
